# p5.js Template

I first use Loop to draw multiple circles
Then I randomly choose the circle size
Then randomly choose the circle's position within the canvas
Then randomly choose the circle's color
Then set the fill color
Then draw the circle with the chosen properties
my circle is dancing aournd
so i used randomSeed() to control it
my circle is too small
so i change the size and amount
they are still overlapping each other
i am thinking to use dist to sepearte the distance
